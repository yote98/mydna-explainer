# What Genetic Tests Cannot Tell You

Understanding the limitations of genetic testing is just as important as understanding the results.

## Genetic Tests CANNOT:

### 1. Predict Your Future With Certainty

- A pathogenic variant does NOT guarantee you will develop a disease
- Penetrance (the chance of developing symptoms) varies widely
- Many people with "high risk" variants never develop the condition
- Environmental and lifestyle factors also play major roles

### 2. Diagnose Most Common Diseases

Genetic tests are NOT diagnostic for:
- Heart disease (mostly polygenic + lifestyle)
- Type 2 diabetes (mostly polygenic + lifestyle)
- Most cancers (85-90% are not hereditary)
- Mental health conditions (complex genetics + environment)
- Alzheimer's disease (APOE is a risk factor, not a diagnosis)

### 3. Tell You Exactly What to Do

Genetic information provides data, not directions:
- Results need interpretation in your personal context
- Medical decisions require professional guidance
- "One-size-fits-all" recommendations don't exist

### 4. Account for Everything

Genetics is only part of your health picture:
- Lifestyle (diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol)
- Environment (exposures, stress, pollution)
- Healthcare access and quality
- Social determinants of health
- Random chance

### 5. Replace Regular Medical Care

Even with "good" genetic results:
- You still need regular check-ups
- Screening recommendations still apply
- Family history still matters
- Symptoms still need evaluation

## Common Misconceptions

### "My genetic test was negative, so I won't get [disease]"

**Wrong.** Most diseases aren't purely genetic. A negative genetic test means you don't have the specific variants tested - not that you're immune to the condition.

### "I have a pathogenic variant, so I'll definitely get sick"

**Wrong.** Penetrance varies. Many pathogenic variants have 40-60% penetrance, meaning more than a third of carriers never develop symptoms.

### "Genetic tests can tell me everything about my health"

**Wrong.** Current tests examine a tiny fraction of the genome. We don't understand most genetic variations yet. And genes are only part of health.

### "My results are permanent and won't change"

**Partially wrong.** While your DNA doesn't change, the interpretation of variants changes as science advances. VUS results are frequently reclassified.

## What Genetic Tests CAN Help With

- Identifying high-risk individuals for targeted screening
- Guiding family planning decisions (carrier testing)
- Selecting medications (pharmacogenomics)
- Confirming suspected genetic conditions
- Understanding family health patterns
- Research participation

## The Bigger Picture

Genetic testing is one tool among many for understanding health. It works best when:
- Combined with family history
- Interpreted by qualified professionals
- Used alongside regular medical care
- Understood within its limitations

Your genes are not your destiny. They're one chapter in a much larger story that includes your choices, environment, healthcare, and yes, some luck.
