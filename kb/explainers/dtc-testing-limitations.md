# Limitations of Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Genetic Testing

## What is DTC Genetic Testing?

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests are tests you can purchase and take at home without going through a healthcare provider. Popular examples include 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and similar services.

## Key Differences: DTC vs Clinical Testing

| Feature | DTC Testing | Clinical Testing |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Ordered by | Consumer directly | Healthcare provider |
| Method | Usually genotyping (spots) | Often sequencing (full genes) |
| Scope | Selected variants only | Comprehensive for target genes |
| Accuracy | Good but not clinical-grade | Highest accuracy standards |
| Interpretation | Automated/limited | Expert clinical interpretation |
| Regulation | Less stringent | Strict FDA/CLIA oversight |

## Important Limitations

### 1. Genotyping vs Sequencing

**DTC tests typically use genotyping:**
- Checks specific known locations in your DNA
- Like checking only certain pages of a book
- May miss variants not on their panel

**Clinical tests often use sequencing:**
- Reads entire genes letter by letter
- More comprehensive
- Catches novel or rare variants

### 2. Limited Variant Coverage

DTC tests check for a small selection of known variants. For example:
- A DTC BRCA test might check 3 specific variants
- A clinical BRCA test sequences the entire gene and can find thousands of possible variants

**A "negative" DTC result does NOT mean you don't have a pathogenic variant - it only means you don't have the specific variants tested.**

### 3. False Positives and Negatives

- DTC tests can have false positives (saying you have something you don't)
- DTC tests can have false negatives (missing something you do have)
- Clinical confirmation is recommended for any significant DTC finding

### 4. Ancestry and Population Limitations

- Most DTC tests are based primarily on European ancestry populations
- May be less accurate for other ancestries
- Risk calculations may not apply to all populations

### 5. Interpretation Without Context

- DTC results don't consider your personal health history
- Don't account for your family history
- May cause unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance

## What to Do With DTC Results

### If you find concerning results:

1. **Don't panic** - DTC results need confirmation
2. **Talk to a healthcare provider** or genetic counselor
3. **Get clinical confirmation** before making any medical decisions
4. **Consider your family history** as an important factor

### For health-related decisions:

- Always confirm DTC findings with clinical-grade testing
- Work with healthcare providers who can interpret results in your full health context
- Don't make major medical decisions based solely on DTC results

## DTC Testing Can Be Useful For:

- Ancestry and genealogy exploration
- Understanding carrier status for family planning (with confirmation)
- Starting a conversation with your doctor
- General education about genetics

## The Bottom Line

DTC genetic tests are a tool for exploration, not a medical diagnosis. Treat them as a starting point for conversation, not a final answer. Any results that might affect your health decisions should be confirmed through clinical channels with proper medical guidance.
