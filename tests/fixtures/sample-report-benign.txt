GENETIC TEST REPORT - SAMPLE (FICTIONAL)
==========================================
Patient: [REDACTED]
Test Date: 2024-03-10
Lab: Example Genetics Laboratory

RESULTS SUMMARY
---------------

NEGATIVE - No Pathogenic Variants Identified

The following genes were analyzed for pathogenic variants:
- BRCA1
- BRCA2
- TP53
- PTEN
- CDH1
- STK11
- PALB2

Results:
No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in the genes listed above.

Variants of Note (Benign/Likely Benign):

Gene: BRCA1
Variant: c.2612C>T (p.Pro871Leu)
Classification: Benign
Zygosity: Heterozygous
rsID: rs799917

This is a common benign polymorphism found in approximately 30% of the general population. It does not increase cancer risk.

Gene: BRCA2
Variant: c.865A>C (p.Asn289His)
Classification: Benign
Zygosity: Heterozygous
rsID: rs766173

This variant has been well-characterized as benign based on population studies and functional evidence.

Gene: PALB2
Variant: c.1010T>C (p.Leu337Ser)
Classification: Likely Benign
Zygosity: Heterozygous
rsID: rs45532440

Based on population frequency and available evidence, this variant is likely benign.

Clinical Interpretation:
This negative result means that no disease-causing variants were identified in the genes tested. However, this does NOT mean zero cancer risk:
- Cancer can still occur due to non-genetic factors
- Variants in genes not included in this panel could still be present
- Some variants may not be detectable by current testing methods

Recommendations:
- Continue age-appropriate cancer screening
- Update family history periodically
- Consider re-testing if family history changes significantly
- Standard screening guidelines still apply

A negative genetic test does not eliminate cancer risk.
