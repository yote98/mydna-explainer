GENETIC TEST REPORT - SAMPLE (FICTIONAL)
==========================================
Patient: [REDACTED]
Test Date: 2024-01-15
Lab: Example Genetics Laboratory

RESULTS SUMMARY
---------------

Gene: BRCA2
Variant: c.1234A>G (p.Asn412Ser)
Classification: Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)
Zygosity: Heterozygous
rsID: rs123456789

Clinical Interpretation:
A heterozygous variant of uncertain significance (VUS) was identified in the BRCA2 gene. This variant results in an amino acid change from asparagine to serine at position 412 of the protein. 

The clinical significance of this variant is currently unknown. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether this variant is pathogenic (disease-causing) or benign (harmless).

Recommendations:
- This result should not be used to guide medical management
- Genetic counseling is recommended to discuss the implications
- Family testing may help clarify the significance of this variant
- Periodic re-evaluation of this variant classification is suggested

Additional Findings:
Gene: CHEK2
Variant: c.470T>C (p.Ile157Thr)
Classification: Likely Benign
Zygosity: Heterozygous
rsID: rs17879961

This variant has been reported as likely benign based on population frequency data and functional studies. No clinical action is recommended.
