GENETIC TEST REPORT - SAMPLE (FICTIONAL)
==========================================
Patient: [REDACTED]
Test Date: 2024-02-20
Lab: Example Genetics Laboratory

RESULTS SUMMARY
---------------

POSITIVE FINDING IDENTIFIED

Gene: MLH1
Variant: c.1852_1854del (p.Lys618del)
Classification: Pathogenic
Zygosity: Heterozygous
rsID: rs267607766
ClinVar ID: VCV000089585

Clinical Interpretation:
A heterozygous pathogenic variant was identified in the MLH1 gene. This gene is associated with Lynch syndrome, also known as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC).

Lynch syndrome is associated with increased risk for:
- Colorectal cancer
- Endometrial cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Other cancers (stomach, urinary tract, brain, skin, etc.)

This variant has been reported in multiple affected individuals and families. Functional studies and co-segregation data support a pathogenic classification.

IMPORTANT: The presence of this variant indicates increased cancer risk but does NOT mean cancer will definitely develop. Risk varies by individual.

Recommendations:
- Genetic counseling is strongly recommended
- Enhanced surveillance protocols should be discussed with healthcare providers
- Family members may be at risk and should consider genetic counseling
- Management guidelines from NCCN or other expert bodies should be reviewed

Additional Findings:
No other pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in the genes tested.

Genes Tested (No Pathogenic Variants Found):
- MSH2: No variants detected
- MSH6: No variants detected
- PMS2: No variants detected
- EPCAM: No variants detected

Penetrance for Lynch syndrome variants varies; not all carriers develop cancer.
