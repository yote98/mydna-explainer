# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

MyDNA Explainer is designed with privacy as a core principle. We understand that genetic information is highly sensitive and personal. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## Key Principles

1. **No Data Storage**: We do not store your genetic report data
2. **No Accounts**: No registration or personal information required
3. **No Tracking**: We do not track your genetic information
4. **Immediate Deletion**: Data is processed in-memory and discarded

## Information We Process

When you use MyDNA Explainer, you may provide:
- Genetic test report text (for translation)
- Variant identifiers (for ClinVar lookups)

**We do not collect or store this information.** It is processed in memory, used only to generate your results, and immediately discarded.

## No Account Required

MyDNA Explainer does not require you to create an account. We do not collect:
- Names or email addresses
- Login credentials
- Payment information
- Personal identifiers

## No Data Retention

Your genetic data is processed in real-time and is NOT:
- Stored in any database
- Saved to disk
- Logged in application logs
- Shared with third parties
- Used for training AI models

Once your session ends, there is no record of the data you submitted.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

### LLM Provider (OpenAI/Anthropic)

Your report text is sent to an AI service for analysis. Please review their privacy policies:
- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

We configure these services to not retain your data for training purposes where such options are available.

### NCBI ClinVar API

Variant lookups query the public ClinVar database. Only the variant identifier (rsID, etc.) is sent, not any personal information.

## Cookies and Analytics

We do not use:
- Tracking cookies
- Analytics services that capture your genetic data
- Marketing pixels or tracking scripts

We may use essential cookies for site functionality only.

## Server Logs

Our server logs contain:
- Request timestamps
- Request IDs (random identifiers)
- Error messages (without user data)

Server logs do NOT contain:
- Your genetic report text
- Variant lookup queries
- IP addresses associated with genetic data

## Data Security

We implement security measures including:
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- No logging of submitted genetic text
- Request IDs only (no content) in server logs
- Regular security reviews
- Secure deployment practices

## Your Recommendations

To further protect your privacy:
- Consider redacting your name and identifiers before pasting report text
- Do not share results with your name attached
- Use the download feature to keep results locally
- Be cautious about sharing genetic information generally

## Children's Privacy

This service is not intended for use by children under 18 without parental consent. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## International Users

If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that your data may be processed on servers located in the US or other countries. By using this service, you consent to this transfer.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:
- Right to know what data is collected (we collect none)
- Right to deletion (nothing to delete)
- Right to opt-out of data sales (we don't sell data)

Since we don't collect or store personal data, these rights are effectively satisfied by design.

## GDPR Compliance (EU Users)

For users in the European Union:
- **Data Controller**: We act as a data processor only, processing data you provide temporarily
- **Legal Basis**: Consent (by using the service) and legitimate interest (providing the service)
- **Data Transfers**: Data may be processed outside the EU via third-party AI services
- **Retention**: No retention - data is processed in-memory and discarded

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.

**Summary:** We take your privacy seriously. Your genetic data is processed only to provide results and is never stored, logged, or shared. We believe this is the only responsible way to handle such sensitive information.
